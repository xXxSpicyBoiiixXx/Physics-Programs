# Physics Programs

This repo will be a collection of physics related problems, organized in thier respective parts. This is just a hobby repo where I can bring both my Physics and Computer Science backgrounds to light. This will be written in the C programming language with details as I really miss doing Physics and this way I can still practice programming while keeping my physics skill on par.
